Functions used:

follow_control_test.m
vbap_test.m

Parameters:
	follow_control_test.m
	head_offset0 = 10;
		head_offset2 = head_offset0;
    head_offset1 = 0;
 		Add dynamic sign switching of heading offset if boat paths cross

		% Gains
		K_p = 0.1;
		K_i = 0.01;
	
	vbap_test.m
		follow_dist = 20;
		% Spring dmin, dmax, ko
		d0 = 25;
		dmin = 20;
		dmax = 50;
		ko = 0.1;
	 Added quadratic repulsion for d < dmin
		
		% Speed and turn rate gains
		Ku = 0.5; % 0.3
		Kd = 0.1; % Derivative gain to avoid collision 0.02

		Kr = 0.4; % 2

		rel_vel = (dist_target - dist_old)/0.1;


 			Adjust rabbit waypoints so turn angles < 90*
 	 Fixed speed command calculation (previously multiplying by Ku twice)
****** Three boats, boat1 follows cube, boat0 and boat2 follow boat1
